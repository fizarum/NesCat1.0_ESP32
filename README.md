# NesCat1.0_ESP32 modification
Modified version of NesCat1.0_ESP32 system(original: https://github.com/nathalis/NesCat1.0_ESP32). Its in progress, so use on your own risk! I want to make separate releases as soon as I get stable version of my mod.
Currently I'm working on software changes, but PCB reworking is planned as well

Planned changes:
 - move from SD7789 to ILI9341 display
 - add PCF8574N for keyboard (keys)
 - add charger module
 - change to Max98357A I2S module
